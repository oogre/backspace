<i>Archive your backspaces | We turn these into book</i>
<p>
	When you use the backspace key, a piece of your soul flies away with these lost words.
	Writing is like shaping the world. Erosion shapes our ideas and turns them into sentences. The most sensitive slices of your ideas fly away like sand and end up in the desert of nothingness.
	We archive the dust of your thoughts in a book. Bcksp.es has been designed to capture these deleted ideas. When your archive is full, we offer you to buy your book.
	We save your backspaces and turn them into books.
